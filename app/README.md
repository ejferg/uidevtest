# UI Developer Test(Earl Ferguson)

This is a UI Developer Test. The development for this test contains 2 version an Angular.js version and a Ember.js
version. I wanted to also do a coffee-script and Backbone version, but I did not have the time.

## Application
All applications are located in the app folder. With the ember and angular folders representing the 2 application.
versions. I may decide to add test to each of the applications using Jasmine.

In development I used a localhost server to test. So some type of server will be needed to test due to security problems
when loading the uidevtest-data.js using ajax.

Ex. http://example.com//uidevtest/app/ember/src/html/index.html <br />
    http://localhost//uidevtest/app/ember/src/html/index.html

## Misc
On the initial list page I decided to have fun with the page so I took a little different approach to the design. I
hope that ok.

All in all this test was really fun to do.
