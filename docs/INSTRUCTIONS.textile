h1. Instructions

h2. Your Task

Using the provided feed data, construct a page that is formatted to match the included mockups. You will only be using one HTML document for this test. Your document will render either a story view or a story list view.

The story view layout should be responsive and render as multi-column (uidevtest/mockup-wide.jpg) for viewports greater than 480 pixels and as single-column (uidevtest/mockup.jpg) below that breakpoint.

Place your HTML in uidevtest/src/html/index.html. All other resources should be saved where appropriate in the uidevtest/src hierarchy.

h2. Feed Data

Your page should load data from the provided datafile. No content should be hard-coded into your document.

uidevtest/src/js/uidevtest-data.json

h2. URLs and page rendering

The page should render the story list view (uidevtest/mockup-list.jpg) when accessed by the URL below.

uidevtest/src/html/index.html

The headline links from the story list view should take us to the individual story view. The page should render one of the five stories from the feed data when accessed by the URLs below.

uidevtest/src/html/index.html?story=sto01
uidevtest/src/html/index.html?story=sto02
uidevtest/src/html/index.html?story=sto03
uidevtest/src/html/index.html?story=sto04
uidevtest/src/html/index.html?story=sto05
